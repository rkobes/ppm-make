To install, execute the sequence

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Win32 users should use the 'make' program on their system.

If you do not have permission to install modules in the
Perl site tree on your system, you can install this in
your own library by

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl \
     INSTALLMAN1DIR=/home/me/man/man1 \
     INSTALLMAN3DIR=/home/me/man/man3
   make
   make test
   make install

To use modules in this location, either set the PERL5LIB
environment variable to include your private module
directory, or else put

   use lib '/home/me/perl/path/to/lib';

at the top of your script.

A Win32 ppm package, suitable for use with ActivePerl
compatible Perl packages is available at
    http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/
for ActivePerl 6xx and at
      http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/
for ActivePerl 8xx. To install, within the ppm shell set the 
repository to
      http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer
for ActivePerl 6xx and to
      http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer58
for ActivePerl 8xx, and then
      ppm> install PPM-Make
