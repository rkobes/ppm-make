NAME
    PPM::Make - Make a ppm package from a CPAN distribution

SYNOPSIS
      my $ppm = PPM::Make->new( [options] );
      $ppm->make_ppm();

DESCRIPTION

    This module automates somewhat some of the steps needed to make a ppm
    (Perl Package Manager) package from a CPAN distribution. It attempts to
    fill in the ABSTRACT and AUTHOR attributes of Makefile.PL, if these
    are not supplied, and also uses pod2html to generate a set of html
    documentation. It also adjusts CODEBASE of package.ppd to reflect
    the generated package.tar.gz or package.zip archive, and can add
    a post-install script via the <INSTALL> field to the ppd file. 
    Such packages are suitable both for local installation via

      C:\.cpan\build\package_src> ppm install

    and for distribution via a repository.

    The module may be used either within a locally installed
    source distribution or else it can fetch and build remote
    distributions.

    As well, there are some helper modules that may be useful
    for maintaining a ppm repository: PPM::Make::RepositorySummary,
    for generating various summary files for a repository, and
    PPM::Make::Bundle, for making a zipped ppm bundle consisting
    of a distribution and all of its prerequisities.

REQUIREMENTS
    Needed software for unpacking and making .tar.gz and
    .zip archives, and a make program, is required. Information
    on authors, as well as a mapping between module and distribution
    names, is obtained from a remote SOAP server - if this is
    unavailable, CPAN.pm and associated indices will be tried,
    for which prior configuration is assumed.

    The software needed for the remote SOAP server is available
    in the CPAN-Search-Lite distribution on CPAN - see
    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/R/RK/RKOBES/.
