=head1 SYNOPSIS

 rep_summary --rep /path/to/ppm/repository

Options:

 [--version]          : print version information and exit
 [--help]             : print this help screen
 [--rep ] location    : specify the ppm repository location

 [--arch ] arch       : specify the architecture for package.xml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<rep_summary> is an interface to C<PPM::Make::RepositorySummary>,
which may be used to generate various summary files as used by
ActiveState's ppm system (C<summary.ppm>, C<searchsummary.ppm>,
C<package.lst>, and, unless excluded by the I<--no_ppm4> option,
C<package.xml>. See L<PPM::Make::RepositorySummary>
for a description of these files. Options include

=over

=item --rep /path/to/ppds

This option, which is required, specifies the path to where
the I<ppd> files are found. The summary files will be written
in this directory.

=item --no-ppm4

If this option is specified, the F<package.xml> file (which
contains some extensions used by ppm4) will not be generated.

=item --arch MSWin32-x86-multi-thread-5.8

If this option is given, it will be used as the
I<ARCHITECTURE> attribute of the I<REPOSITORYSUMMARY>
element of F<package.xml>.

=item [--help]

This prints out a short help screen and exits.

=item [--version]

This prints out some version information and exits.
